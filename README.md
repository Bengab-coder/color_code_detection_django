## Django Color Detection Project
Finds all the colors in an image

I Have made a few changes:

- Adding type annotations in functions for color detection functions to help you understand what each function does.
- Cleaned up color detection code and moved everything into functions that return results.
- You can now call `get_image_hexcolors(image_path)` to return a list of the colors which you need to display in your template
